# >>>> Explanation Text 2/18
# Concept of Tuples
# keys() and values()
# While .items() returns an array of tuples with each tuple 
# consisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary:

# The .keys() method returns a list of the dictionary's keys, and
# The .values() method returns a list of the dictionary's values.
# Again, these methods will not return the keys or values from 
# the dictionary in any specific order.

# You can think of a tuple as an immutable (that is, unchangeable) list. 
# Tuples are surrounded by ()s and can contain any data type.

# >>>> 4/18 Text Explanation - List Comprehension 
# if we wanted to generate a list according to some logic
# â€”for example, a list of all the even numbers from 0 to 50?

# Python's answer to this is the list comprehension. 
# List comprehensions are a powerful way to generate lists 
# using the for/in and if keywords we've learned.

# evens_to_50 = [i for i in range(51) if i % 2 == 0]
# print (evens_to_50)

# >>>> 5/18 Examples of List Comprehension
# new_list = [x for x in range(1, 6)]
# # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# This will create a new_list populated by the numbers one to five. 
# If you want those numbers doubled, you could use:

# doubles = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6)]
# # => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# And if you only wanted the doubled numbers that are evenly divisible 
# by three:

# doubles_by_3 = [x * 2 for x in range(1, 6) if (x * 2) % 3 == 0]
# # => [6]
