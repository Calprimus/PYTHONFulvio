# >>>> Explanation Text 2/18
# Concept of Tuples
# keys() and values()
# While .items() returns an array of tuples with each tuple 
# consisting of a key/value pair from the dictionary:

# The .keys() method returns a list of the dictionary's keys, and
# The .values() method returns a list of the dictionary's values.
# Again, these methods will not return the keys or values from 
# the dictionary in any specific order.

# You can think of a tuple as an immutable (that is, unchangeable) list. 
# Tuples are surrounded by ()s and can contain any data type.

# >>>> 4/18 Text Explanation - List Comprehension 
# if we wanted to generate a list according to some logic
# â€”for example, a list of all the even numbers from 0 to 50?

# Python's answer to this is the list comprehension. 
# List comprehensions are a powerful way to generate lists 
# using the for/in and if keywords we've learned.

# evens_to_50 = [i for i in range(51) if i % 2 == 0]
# print (evens_to_50)
